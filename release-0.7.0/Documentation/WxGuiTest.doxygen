/*! \mainpage WxGuiTesting

    WxGuiTesting is a small static library which facilitates testing of <A href=http://www.wxwidgets.org>wxWidgets </A> applications and classes. 

    WxGuiTesting at present works only with (and requires) <A href="http://www.cppunit.org">CppUnit</A> unit-testing framework.

    It provides 
       - A framework for unit testing individual wxWidgets GUI classes
       - A framework for regression testing whole applications
       - A framework for easily capturing wxWidgets user interaction events as a source file with which to build regression tests.
       - Limited capability to test and capture events for <A href="http://wxvtk.sourceforge.net">wxVTK</A>, a <A href=http://www.wxwidgets.org>wxWidgets </A> wrapper for the <A href="http://www.vtk.org">VTK</A> 3D graphics library.

     WxGuiTesting was originally developed by Reinhold Füreder at the University of Exeter in the UK as part of develping an application for <A href="http://www.simpleware.com">SimpleWare, Ltd.</A>. His <A href="http://swwxguitesting.wefi.net/">swWxGuiTesting webpage</A> has more details along with an excerpt from his thesis explaining in detail how he arrived at the final design.

     \section Dependencies
	 - <A href=http://www.wxwidgets.org>wxWidgets </A> \b Required
	 - <A href="http://www.cppunit.org">CppUnit</A> \b Required Unit testing framework 
	 - <A href="http://www.vtk.org">VTK</A> \b Optional 3D Manipulation library
	 - <A href="http://wxvtk.sourceforge.net">wxVTK</A> \b Optional An old version is included, but you may wish to get a newer one if you're using VTK.
	 - <A href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jorgb/wxcrp">wxCRP</A> \b Optional A program for generating source files from templates. Microsoft Windows® only. Templates are provided in the wxCRP directory.
	 - <A href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</A> \b Optional but you'll want it if you need to regenerate the HTML documentation or to make docs in some other format.
	 - The project originally required CMake (and you'll need it to build VTK if you're using it), but it has since been converted to use <A href="http://www.bakefile.org">bakefile</A> just like wxWidgets.
