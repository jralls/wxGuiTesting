CMake version 2.4.5 is strongly recommended and required for wxWidgets 2.8.0

===========================================================
Microsoft Windows
===========================================================
Using CMake 2.4.5
Build generator: Visual Studio 6.0

Initially build the required third party modules (if non-standard building
settings are required, these are outlined in parentheses below, and specified
in some detail in the doxygen documentation):
    - CppUnit: 1.8 - 1.12.0 (Built according to CppUnit documentation)
    - wxWidgets: 2.8.0
        * "Instructions" below assume a static build, but analogue steps for
          dynamic builds should work as well.
        * Also required: wxrc executable
Optional:
    - VTK: 4.x - 5.0.2 (Built with CMake)

1. ThirdPartyLibs

a. CMake 2.4.5

    Binary: -> D:\CVS\swWxGuiTesting\ThirdPartyLibs\CxxBuild

    -> [Configure] -> Error (CppUnit) -> Cancel

    CPPUNIT_PATH: -> D:\CVS\CppUnit

    -> [Configure]

    Only if you want to test VTK Capture & Replay:
        USE_VTK_DEPENDENT_PARTS: -> ON

        -> [Configure] -> Error (VTK) -> Cancel

        VTK_DIR: -> D:\CVS\VTKBuild

        -> [Configure] -> under MSW several times: -> Warning (VTK is forcing linker flags...) -> OK

		wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR: -> D:\CVS\wxWidgets-2.8.0

    -> OK

Only in case you want to test VTK Capture & Replay and have therefore set USE_VTK_DEPENDENT_PARTS to ON:
b. Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
    Open workspace: D:\CVS\swWxGuiTesting\ThirdPartyLibs\CxxBuild\ThirdPartyLibs.dsw
    Build workspace in debug and release configuration (there is only wxVTK project)


c. Doxygen 1.3.9.1

b. Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
    Open workspace: D:\CVS\swWxGuiTesting\Testing\CxxBuild\Testing.dsw
    Build workspace in debug and release configuration

    Run build targets/executables (= test suites):
      - CppTestSwWxGuiTesting
      - CppGuiTestEventSimulation
      - CppGuiTestCaptureReplay
      - CppGuiTestModalDialog

    Open workspace: D:\CVS\swWxGuiTesting\UsingSwWxGuiTesting\CxxBuild\UsingSwWxGuiTesting.dsw
    Build workspace in debug and release configuration

    Run build targets/executables (= test suites):
      - CppGuiTestCaptureReplay (almost identical to the one in 2. Testing)

Using CMake 2.4.5
Build generator: Unix Makefiles

Initially build the required third party modules (if non-standard building
settings are required, these are outlined in parentheses below, and specified
in some detail in the doxygen documentation):
    - CppUnit: 1.10.2 (Install lib and dev packages for CppUnit)
    - wxWidgets: 2.8.0
        * "Instructions" below assume a static build, but analogue steps for
          dynamic builds should work as well. My configuration for wxWidgets build:
            "configure --with-gtk --enable-debug_flag --with-opengl"
        * Build for GTK2 including OpenGL
        * Also required: wxrc executable
Optional:
    - VTK: 5.0 (Built with CMake)

Potentially optional steps, but necessary on my system:
    * Install X11 header packages: xlibs-dev
    * Install mesa-glx (incl. -dev) and/or nvidia-glx (incl. -dev) packages
    * Potentially adapt LD_CONFIG_PATH to include /usr/local/lib to allow using/running the
        standard build of wxrc tool
