WxGuiTesting Sample

This is a slightly modified version of the XRC demo from wxWidgets. The
modification makes the main frame into an MDI parent and converts a couple
of the dialogs into MDI children. Using frames in this way makes testing
work better because of the problems with modal dialogs.

You'll find here makefiles for msvc nmake and gnumake, along with
configuration files. Edit the appropriate configuration file to get the
right paths and library names, run make, and try the test and capture apps
that result.

Running under Debian Etch, the CompilerOutputter won't write to
std::cerr. This is kludged with a cpp macro.

Notice that the last testcase fails on all platforms except MacOSX. That's
because it's for a window demonstrating platform-specific XRC features, and
only the MacOSX one is coded.

If you want to see what events are supported (or not!), run xrcdemo_capture,
start capturing, and open the controls dialog. Then play with every control
and note the log window. The unsupported event messages are also written to
SimpleCRTest.cpp.crx.
