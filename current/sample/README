WxGuiTesting Sample

This is a slightly modified version of the XRC demo from
wxWidgets. The modification makes the main frame into an MDI parent
and converts a couple of the dialogs into MDI children. Using frames
in this way makes testing work better because of the problems with
modal dialogs.

You'll find here makefiles for msvc nmake and gnumake, along with
configuration files. Edit the appropriate configuration file to get
the right paths and library names, run make, and try the test and
capture apps that result.

There are a couple of flakey behaviors:
In Microsoft Windows, the MDI Client Window doesn't draw unless you
minimize and restore the window... and after you do that, the toolbar
doesn't work any more. I'm pretty sure that's a wxWidgets problem.

Running under Debian Etch, the test reports failures but doesn't
report what they are. That's probably a logging issue in the library.
