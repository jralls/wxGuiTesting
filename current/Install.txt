/*! \page Installing How to Build and Install WxGuiTesting

\section prereqs Prerequisites:

1. wxWidgets, http://www.wxwidgets.org, a cross-platform programming
   framework in  C++. swWxGuiTesting is all about unit and regression testing
   wxWidgets programs. swWxGuiTesting is tested against versiont 2.8.6
   on Microsoft Windows XP®, Linux Debian Etch, and Macintosh OSX®
   versions 4 and 5. Mandatory.

2. CppUnit, http://cppunit.sourceforge.net, a C++ unit testing
   framework. swWxGuiTesting has been tested against version 1.12.0. Mandatory.

3. VTK, http://www.vtk.org, is a graphics toolkit which works on top
   of opengl. swWxGuiTesting is capable of capturing and replaying events
   via vtk. Optional.

4. wxVTK, http://wxvtk.sourceforge.net, a wx control for VTK. There's
   an older version in the sources, but you may want to get the
   latest. Optional.

5. wxCRP, http://www.xs4all.nl/~jorgb/wxcrp, a template generator for 
   Microsoft Windows®. Some templates are provided for automatically 
   generating swWxGuiTesting test suites with wxCRP. Optional.

6. Bakefile, http://www.bakefile.org, a cross-platform builder of
   native build chains. Build chains are provided for Microsoft Visual
   C® nmake, Microsoft Visual Studio 6® project files, and GNU
   autoconf. If you need to create other build chains for your
   toolset, you'll need bakefile to do so.

7. DOxygen, http://www.doxygen.org, a source-code documentation
   system. You'll need this to build the class documentation into a
   nice set of html pages with pretty inheritance graphs. Optional.

\section build Building:

\subsection Micrsoft Windows
\subsubsection Enivronment Variables:
Set the following environment variables. If you're going to use nmake
from the command prompt, you can just do it from the command line
first; otherwise, use the Control Panel.

WXWIN=[DRIVE:]\Path\to\wxWidgets\install\directory
CPPUNIT=[DRIVE:]\Path\to\CppUnit\install\directory
VTK_DIR=[DRIVE:]\Path\to\VTK\install\directory 
     (if you're going to use VTK)

If the DLLs for wxWidgets, CppUnit and VTK aren't already on your
path, fix that too while you're at it.

\subsubsection msw Microsoft NMake:

It is important to install wxWidgets, CppUnit, and (if used) VTK on
paths with no spaces in them.

Navigate to build/msw. You'll find there two files, config.vc and
makefile.vc. Edit config.vc to define the various variables. You'll
need to set the WX_SHARED, WX_DEBUG, WX_UNICODE, WX_MONOLITHIC, and
WX_VERSION to match a wxWidgets library which you have installed
already. SHARED, UNICODE, and BUILD set the parameters for the
swWxGuiTesting library and test applications.  If you're using VTK,
set USE_VTK to TRUE.

Now run nmake -f makefile.vc. The library and executables will be
build in the present directory.

\subsection msvs  Microsoft Visual Studio 6®:

You'll find the solution and project files in build/msw; open MSVS and
load swWxGuiTesting.sln.

Now comes the fun part, because there's no automatic way to configure
MSVS.

First select from the list of builds the one which matches your
wxWidgets installation and build intentions (For example, DLL Unicode
Debug Multilib  USE_VTK=0).

If you're using a build with USE_VTK=0, it's prudent to open
Configuration Manager (select the solution, then right-click: It's on
the context menu. It's also available from the property pages) and
make sure that the VTKUnitTest project isn't selected for building.

If you set up the environment variables correctly, you're ready to go.
Build the solution (either from the Build Menu or by pressing F7 on
the keyboard). 

\subsection autoconf GNU Autoconf (UNIX and Macintosh OSX):

Make a new directory at the top level (I like to call it build_osx or
build_unix), change to that directory and run 
\code
../configure
make
make install
\endcode
If you don't specify otherwise (via the --prefix option to configure)
your library and headers will wind up in /usr/local/lib and
/usr/local/include, respectively.

If you want VTK support, specify --with-vtk=/path/to/VTK. If you're
using a version of VTK other than 5.0, specify --with-vtk-version=#.#
(replacing #.# with the actual version number, of course).

The test and sample apps will stay in your build directory (in the bin
subdirectory). 

MacOSX note: The Makefile can build app bundles for you, but you need
to tell it where your wxWidgets sources are, e.g. 
\code
../configure WXSRCPATH=/usr/local/src/wxMac-2.8.6
\endcode
so that it can find the Info.plist.in file. If you don't have sources
(OSX Tiger and Leopard both include wxWidgets), there's one from
wxWidgets 2.8.4 in build/macosx/src/mac/carbon. Just set WXSRCPATH to
../build/macosx (assuming that you're building in a subdirectory of
this one).

By default, configure will set SHARED, UNICODE, and DEBUG to match the
primary library found by wx-config. If you want otherwise, tell
configure (e.g., `../configure DEBUG=0 to build a library without
symbols against a debug version of wxWidgets).
