/*! \mainpage swWxGuiTesting

    swWxGuiTesting is a framework allowing unit testing of wxWidgets based GUIs
    and whole applications; it's core motivation is to some extent based on
    ideas of TestFirstUserInterface's mailing list, thus, the resulting
    framework likely to allow TDD of wxWidgets based GUI code.

    It's currently remaining proprietary (non-standard wxWidgets) dependency is
    the included swFrameworkDependent target:

    - swFrameworkDependent is the attempt to reduce dependencies from
    swWxGuiTesting to the SimplewareFramework. Without these dependencies
    swWxGuiTesting would not be able to work, as it (a) provides some addtional
    structure that a future application under test must implement, and (b)
    provides means of accessing otherwise not available, but vital information.


  \section buildSwWxGuiTesting Building

    Please see separate building notes document, whereas (external) usage from
    outside the testing framework is demonstrated by the "UsingSwWxGuiTesting"
    project.

    \subsection wxrcProblem MSVC++ vs. wxrc

    Using CMake custom command's ability the wxrc executable tool is used to
    produce the capture panel in the shape of an easily includable C++ file
    with embedded resources, based on the original XRC file. This facilitates
    the usage of capturing in other targets easier as it prevents the need of
    specifying or carrying around the concrete directory name containing the
    capture panel XRC resource.

    Unfortunately, MSVC++ and wxrc.exe do not follow the same return code
    conventions. Thus, when building it the first time the C++ file is
    correctly produced, but MSVC++ thinks it has failed due to the return code.
    Only in a second run the building succeeds.


	\section docSwWxGuiTesting Documentation

  	Reinhold's MPhil thesis chapter is the main source of information about this
    project	in particular with respect to the underlying theory and concepts: see
    http://reinholdfuereder.portland.co.uk/swWxGuiTesting.pdf

  	Much more than a proof of concept is Simpleware's application ScanCAD -- the
    main goal of Reinhold's MPhil study -- which is already using and applying
    swWxGuiTesting.


  \section futureSwWxGuiTesting Future Work

    Besides aspects mentioned in the aforementioned thesis chapter (most
    importantly detecting and dealing with test case failures), the most likely
    case for enhancements of the testing framework concerns the event
    simulation helper class (swWxGuiTestEventSimulationHelper) and the closely
    linked Capturing & Replay (C&R) classes.

    The helper class (a) frees the developer from the need to know the
    individual control specific event simulation variations, and (b) hides the
    actual implementation in the optimistic case of corrections in future
    wxWidgets versions with respect to simulating events.

    For the sake of comprehension each event simulation type adding should be
    followed by adding the corresponding C&R support. This consists of (1) a new
    event capturing class (e.g. swCRSpinCtrlUpdateEvent), (2) taking this new
    event capturing class in the C&R event factory into account
    (swCREventFactory::CreateEvent() method), and (3) deleting the event type
    from the check for unsupported events leading to a comment in the "capture
    script" (swCREventCaptureManager::FilterEvent() method).

    In order to early detect any changes in the event generation by upgrading
    wxWidgets version, each event simulation helper method must have a
    corresponding GUI test case in the CppGuiTestWxGuiTesting project. That is:
      - a test case in swWxGuiTestEventSimulationHelperTest class
      - using or simulating an event in swWxGuiTestEvtSimHlpFrame class

    VtkWxGuiTesting allows capture & replay of VTK render window interactions,
    but has admittedly obvious limitations concerning the generation of
    maintenable test cases.
