	* swWxGuiTestTempInteractive.cpp
	(WxGuiTestTempInteractive::ShowCurrentGui): New unicode fix.

	
2007-12-23  John Ralls  <john@manjusri.ceridwen.fremont.ca.us>

	* swWxGuiTestTempInteractive.cpp: Rewritten to create a new dialog
	on every call to ShowCurrentGui. The original created a dialog on
	the first invocation and used it until the interactive object was 
	destroyed, which ignored subsequent calls with filename and line #
	so the original filename and line number were produced every time.

	* swWxGuiTestTempInteractive.h: Added the warning notice for the
	TEMP_INTERACTIVE_GUI_TEST macro.
