	* build/bakefile/swWxGuiTesting.bkl: Created new library target
	swFramework to hold code needed by the test programs but not by
	the library. 

	* build/bakefile/files.bkl: Separated swFramework files into
	controls, which are now in group FD_TEST_SOURCES and those needed
	for the library, in FD_LIB_SOURCES

	* include/wxGuiTest/swWxGuiTestEventSimulationHelper.h
	* src/swWxGuiTesting/swWxGuiTestHelper.cpp
	* src/swWxGuiTesting/CapturedEvents/swCRTextUpdateEvent.cpp
	* src/swWxGuiTesting/CapturedEvents/swCRMenuSelectionEvent.h
	* src/swWxGuiTesting/CapturedEvents/swCRSpinCtrlUpdateEvent.h: 
	Removed all references to swFramework

	* src/swWxGuiTesting/CapturedEvents/swCRMenuSelectionEvent.cpp
	(CRMenuSelectionEvent::Process): Refactored Process() with
	"Extract Method".

	* sample/rc/custclass.xrc:
	* sample/rc/frame.xrc:
	* sample/rc/platform.xrc: Corrected class of MDIframes.
	
	* sample/myframe.cpp:
	* sample/ReplayTest.cpp: Fixed capitalization errors exposed in Linux. 


2007-12-28    <Owner@WIDGET-2>

	* sample/myframe.cpp (MyFrame, OnCustomClassToolOrMenuCommand):
	(OnPlatformPropertyToolOrMenuCommand): Changed LoadFrame to
	LoadObject, which is what's needed for MDI-frames.

	* swWxGuiTestTempInteractive.cpp
	(WxGuiTestTempInteractive::ShowCurrentGui): New unicode fix.

	
2007-12-23  John Ralls  <john@manjusri.ceridwen.fremont.ca.us>

	* swWxGuiTestTempInteractive.cpp: Rewritten to create a new dialog
	on every call to ShowCurrentGui. The original created a dialog on
	the first invocation and used it until the interactive object was 
	destroyed, which ignored subsequent calls with filename and line #
	so the original filename and line number were produced every time.

	* swWxGuiTestTempInteractive.h: Added the warning notice for the
	TEMP_INTERACTIVE_GUI_TEST macro.
