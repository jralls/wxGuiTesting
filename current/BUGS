WxGuiTestTimedDialogEnder works only in M$Win (if there).

	Blocking elements (modal dialogs, context menus) are generally
	implemented as native controls, stopping the wx event loop
	while they're active. WxGuiTesting needs access to the native
	event loop in order for it to work properly with these controls.

Capture problems:

	XRCParse returns the first dialog box that matches a
	signature, not necessarily the one that's gotten called. This
	makes Capture results incorrect; the user must hand-correct
	the dialog box name/id.

	Capture redeclares variables repeatedly in capture results.

	Capture doesn't handle toolbars correctly in OSX.
